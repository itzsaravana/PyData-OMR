      "   - The **denominator** (`denom`) accumulates the square of the differences between the `x` points and `mean_x`. This is a measure of the variance of `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Slope and intercept calculation**: Once the loop is complete, the function calculates the slope as the quotient of `numer` by `denom`. This slope indicates how much `y` changes for a one-unit change in `x`. The intercept is computed as `mean_y - slope * mean_x`, which determines where the line would intercept the `y`-axis (the `y` value when `x=0`).\n",

      "Summary: Gemini, formerly known as Bard, is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google. Based on the large language model (LLM) of the same name and developed as a direct response to the meteoric rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT, it was launched in a limited capacity in March 2023 before expanding to other countries in May. It was previously based on PaLM, and initially the LaMDA family of large language models.\n",
      "LaMDA had been developed and announced in 2021, but it was not released to the public out of an abundance of caution. OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard and sent them into a panic, prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company launched Bard in February 2023, which took center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December. Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand in February 2024, coinciding with the launch of an Android app.\n",
      "Gemini has received lukewarm responses. It became the center of controversy in February 2024, when social media users reported that it was generating historically inaccurate images of historical figures as people of color, with conservative commentators decrying its alleged bias as \"wokeness\".\n"
